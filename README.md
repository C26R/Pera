# Pera Financial Dashboard
Pera is a financial dashboard that I have built to help manage and track my finances. It retrieves its financial data from the [Akahu API](https://www.akahu.nz).

The website itself is still in early-stage development. I will continue updating it.

You will need to obtain a user access token and app ID token from Akahu and store their values in a .env file in the root folder of the project. Execute app/db/db.sql to create the database file.
