# Pera Financial Dashboard
Pera is a financial dashboard that I have built to help manage and track my finances. It retrieves its financial data from the [Akahu API](https://www.akahu.nz).

I have included a sample database in this repository to showcase the site and it is not connected to Akahu API (hence why the refresh buttons are disabled). If you want to connect it to Akahu API, you must create an Akahu API account and supply the Authorization and X-Akahu-ID fields in api.py and enable the buttons.

The website itself is still in early-stage development. I will continue updating this repository to make the website more responsive, accessible, and feature-rich.
